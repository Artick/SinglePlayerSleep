Version 2.13.5

Added permission for command based update checking (permission: "sps.update" command: "/sps update"). 
Update check config setting now only controls the automatic notifications on join.
Added config setting to disable all broadcast messages, while enabling anyone to sleep without the ability to cancel it (as requested by BinaryCrafter).
Added config setting to set a minimum interval between sleep and cancel attempts, thus stopping players from using the plugin to spam chat (as requested by CloudeLecaw).
Improved some descriptions in config.yml and plugin.yml.
Added new language entries for the new features. They require translation into other languages (contact me if you can help translate).
Improved code formatting and efficiency. Moved some repeated code into reusable functions.
